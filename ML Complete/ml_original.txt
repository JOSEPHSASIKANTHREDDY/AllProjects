Interact with training file system

The SAP Leonardo Machine Learning foundation provides a remote file system to which
the training, testing, and validation data can be uploaded and trained upon.

The training file system configuration needs to be fetched for the current
instance of the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning foundation. In this process, the training
file system will also be provisioned, in case it has not already. To initialize the training 
file system, please execute 'cf sapml fs init'.

The training file system can be managed via the following sub-commands:
 * init
 * put
 * get
 * delete
 * list
 * config

The training file system is exposed through an Amazon S3 compliant API, whose endpoint
and credentials can get acquired by executing 'cf sapml fs config'. With these 
credentials, any Amazon S3 compatible tool can be used to interact with the training file system.

All files and directories are stored in the 'data' bucket.

For more information about the sub-commands use cf sapml help config <sub-command> 

Examples:
  # Initialize training file system
  cf sapml fs init

  # List top level files and directories
  cf sapml fs list

  # Upload file.txt to sample.txt on the training file system
  cf sapml fs put file.txt sample.txt

  # Download sample.txt from the training file system
  # to the local file file.txt
  cf sapml fs get sample.txt file.txt

  # Delete sample.txt from the training file system
  cf sapml fs delete sample.txt

  # Get training file system endpoint and access credentials
  cf sapml fs config

Usage:
  cf sapml fs [command]

Available Commands:
  config      Show configuration parameters for file system access
  delete      Delete files or directories
  get         Download files for directories
  init        Initialize remote file system
  list        List files and directories
  put         Upload files and directories

Flags:
  -h, --help   Display Cloud Foundry help.

Global Flags:
  -i, --insecure   Disable SSL certificate verification. Not recommended!
  -v, --verbose    Enable verbose output.

Use "cf sapml help fs [command]" for more information about a command.

The Retrain Service provides an easy way to 'fine-tune' a generic machine learning model to a custom use case.
You can use this service without being a Machine Learning Expert. The generic or base model is provided by SAP.
The Retrain Service adapts the generic model to a specific model using the provided training data by the user.
Thus, classification results for the specific data-set are greatly improved compared to the generic model.

Submit, delete or list retraining jobs. List or delete retrained model from model repository. 
Deploy, undeploy or list deployed retrained models.

Retrain service can be managed through following sub-commands:
  * job_submit
  * job_delete
  * jobs
  * models
  * model_delete
  * model_deploy
  * model_undeploy
  * model_deployments

For more information about the sub-commands use cf sapml help retraining <sub-command>

Examples:
  # Submit a retraining job
  cf sapml retraining job_submit my_retrain.json

  # Delete retraining job
  cf sapml retraining job_delete dataset-20news-2017-10-11t1034z

  # List all submitted retraining jobs
  cf sapml retraining jobs

  # List all retrained models
  cf sapml retraining models

  # Delete the retrained model
  cf sapml retraining model_delete my_model 1

  # Deploy retrained model
  cf sapml retraining model_deploy my_model 1

  # Undeploy the deployed retrained-model
  cf sapml retraining model_undeploy 22174f4c-6122-4a04-bbe5-39567066013a

  # List all deployed retrained-models
  cf sapml retraining model_deployments

Usage:
  cf sapml retraining [command]

Available Commands:
  job_delete        Delete retraining job
  job_submit        Submit retraining job
  jobs              List retraining jobs
  model_delete      Delete retrained model
  model_deploy      Deploy a retrained model
  model_deployments List deployments of retrained models
  model_undeploy    Undeploy a retrained model
  models            List models for retrained model

Flags:
  -h, --help          Display Cloud Foundry help.
  -m, --mode string   Retrain mode, 'image', 'text' or 'od' (required).

Global Flags:
  -i, --insecure   Disable SSL certificate verification. Not recommended!

The Retrain Service provides an easy way to 'fine-tune' a generic machine learning model to a custom use case.
You can use this service without being a Machine Learning Expert. The generic or base model is provided by SAP.
The Retrain Service adapts the generic model to a specific model using the provided training data by the user.
Thus, classification results for the specific data-set are greatly improved compared to the generic model.

Submit, delete or list retraining jobs. List or delete retrained model from model repository. 
Deploy, undeploy or list deployed retrained models.

Retrain service can be managed through following sub-commands:
  * job_submit
  * job_delete
  * jobs
  * models
  * model_delete
  * model_deploy
  * model_undeploy
  * model_deployments

For more information about the sub-commands use cf sapml help retraining <sub-command>

Examples:
  # Submit a retraining job
  cf sapml retraining job_submit my_retrain.json

  # Delete retraining job
  cf sapml retraining job_delete dataset-20news-2017-10-11t1034z

  # List all submitted retraining jobs
